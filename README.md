# üåÉ markdown-it-image-caption (wizardified)

**Note:** this is a quick fork of [@andatoshiki/markdown-it-image-caption](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@andatoshiki/markdown-it-image-caption) but with full Typescript support and no unnecessary `<strong>` tags.
<hr/>

This [markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it) plugin allows you to easily wrap your markdown images in `<figure>` and add a `<figcaption>` to them if you add an extra string after the image source. You can optionally leave it as an `<img>` or just a standalone `<figure>` as well.

### ‚úèÔ∏è The syntax:<br>
```markdown
![alt-text](image-source 'caption')
```
And with some extra styling,
### ‚ú® This renders into:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/031a6a63-4eea-4060-ba94-2d3160dc7b0c)

<br>

**Note:** if there is no caption provided e.g. a decorative image, it will be an `<img>` like usual. If you want to keep it a `<figure>` for semantic or other reasons, just replace the caption with `:::nocaption` like this:<br>
```markdown
![alt-text](image-source ':::nocaption')
```
